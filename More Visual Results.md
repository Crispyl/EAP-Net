## EAP-Net's Attention
The figure depicts the attention heat maps of global learning branch (GL), pose assistant branch (PA), enhanced pose assistant branch (EPA), PA+EPA and EAP-Net. Compared with PA, EPA enhances the attention on local points by feature drop. By integrating PA and EPA into GL, EAP-Net reduces the attention on clothes, special items or background.
